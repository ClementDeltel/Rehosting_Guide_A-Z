# Writing a Technical Document

_When writing a technical document to describe a problem to a coworker or customer, there are three main categories that you should hit_

1. Background
	
	- Describe what the problem is
	- Describe how you found this problem
	- Describe what the problem impacts
	- Describe what the job/transaction/tool is about
	- Provide related binaries & versions

2. Symptoms & Replicate the error

	- Show the problem, but do not provide an opinion
	- Show how you can replicate the error
		- Be clear and concise
		- Avoid creating additional issues
	- Provide analysis
		- Give your opinion
	- Provide proof
		- show a before and after

3. Solution

	- Suggest a change
		- Is the customer doing something that OpenFrame is not equipped to handle
	- Request a patch
		- Is this something that should work, but is not working?
		- Is this a new feature that OpenFrame does not yet have?
	- Ask about a workaround
		- Can this be easily solved by changing one or two things?
