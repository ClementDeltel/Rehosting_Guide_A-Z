This script gives you the URL addresses of the JEUS applications such as OFMiner, OFGW, OFManager, and the Domain Admin Server. This allows you to copy and paste the url of the desired application directly from putty into a web browser. This can be very useful if you forget to write down the URL address of one of the applications.
