# Dataset Migration

The purpose of this guide is to give the user detailed step by step process for migrating datasets. Datasets can come in many different types, such as PDS, GDG, and VSAM, and the options needed for DSMIGIN will vary from dataset to dataset. By using this guide, you will know which options are needed for each dataset.

# 1. The dsmigin Command

The dsmigin command is mainly used for converting EBCDIC mainframe datasets to ASCII OpenFrame datasets. Upon successful migration, the dataset will be catalogued. 

## 1.1 General Usage

```bash
dsmigin <src_file> <dest_file> [options]
```

| -sosi <sosi_type>    | When two-byte characters are used within a record field, a SOSI character is used to differentiate them from one-byte characters.  [SOSI TYPES]  - 1 = so[EBC]si --> so[ASC]si  Does not convert SOSI (DEFAULT)  - 2 = so[EBC]si --> _[ASC]_  Converts SOSI to space  - 3 = so[EBC]si --> [ASC]  Deletes a SOSI and fills the deleted SOSI area in the right side of the field to convert with space characters  - 4 = so[JEF]si --> so[ASC]si  Converts JEF SOSI to ASCII SOSI  - 5 = BMS map conversion  Converts non-mapped characters into '0x2E' instead of '0x00'. This option is useful when migrating BMS maps. It is used when a two-byte character without SOSI is displayed as a value of the original BMS map INITIAL statement. Note: When migrating the BMS map, the miscadjust tool, used after dsmigin, may abnormally operate if '0x00' is included within a result file, and so this option can be used to enable the mscadjust tool to normally work for the file.  - 6 = No SOSI conversion  Considers data as a one-byte character regardless of the existance of SOSI values, and converts it.  - 7 = so[EBC]si --> [ASC]_  Deletes SOSI. Fills the deleted SOSI area in front of the column 72 with space characters. Like a COBOL application, columns from 72, a comment area, are used for resource migration.  - 8 = so[EBC]si --> _[ASC]  Deletes SOSI and fills the deleted SOSI area in the back of column 7 with space characters. Like a COBOL application, columns 1 to 7, which area comment areas, are used for resource migration.  - 9 = so[EBC]si --> ?[ASC]?  Converts SOSI characters using SOSI characters registered in CPM. |

| -F                   | If the dataset is already registered in the catalog, the existing dataset and catalog item will be deleted, data will be re-imported, and the dataset will be re-registered. As the result existing registration information (such as the unit, volume, and creation date) will be overwritten. If the [-N] option is specified, the cataloged item will not be processed.  If this option is not specified and the dataset to be imported is already registered in the catalog, an error message will be displayed and the job will be stopped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -D                   | Displays detailed information about the EBCDIC to ASCII conversion and abnormal data that is found during the PACKED DECIMAL or ZONED DECIMAL field value conversion. Also shows debugging information useful to analyze migration issues.  A value between 1 and 3 can be specified:  - 1: Displays some important information while performing migration  - 2: In addition to 1, displays error information that occurs when converting codes.  - 3: In addition to 2, displays data before and after record conversion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
