##ncpu section

the ncpu command gives similar output to lscpu to collect information regarding how many cores are allocated to the machine, how much memory, and what operating system is being used.

The ncpu binary can be found in $JEUS_HOME/bin

It should be executed like so:

```bash
cd $JEUS_HOME/bin
./ncpu
```

Copy and paste the ncpu output into the ncpu output section of the template.
